# Bootstrap Social Buttons

**Clean (unofficial) social media buttons for Bootstrap using Font Awesome.**

[See a live example](http://noizwaves.github.io/bootstrap-social-buttons/)

Bootstrap Social Buttons is a plugin/mixin for Twitter Bootstrap that provides great looking (unofficial) themes for various social media buttons.

This works great with Font Awesome, which provides great looking icons for various social media actions.

Themes provided include:
- Facebook
- Twitter
- Github
- Pinterest
- LinkedIn
- Google Plus
- Instragram

## Requirements

- Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.1 (although older versions should be fine too).
- Font Awesome 3.0.2 (again, older versions should be fine).

## Installation

There is a LESS file named social-buttons.less that can be included with a custom Bootstrap build.

Note: if you want to use Font Awesome, you should disable the icons mixin (by removing the sprites.less import in bootstrap.less).
